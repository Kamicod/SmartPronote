## ‚ùì What is SmartPronote?

SmartPronote is a tool that lets you synchronize your Pronote homework, timetable and grades with other services like Google Calendar, Google Tasks or IFTTT (for notifications).

## ‚öíÔ∏è How does it work?

SmartPronote keeps track of your data by fetching the content of your Pronote account every X minutes (changeable in the configuration file). It stores the ids of the homework, timetable and grades in a database file to know what's old and what's new. From there it can send push notifications to your phone when you have a new grade, unjustified absences _etcetera_.

## üñºÔ∏è I wanna see examples

Here are a few examples of the premade modules:

- ### üóìÔ∏è Google Calendar
